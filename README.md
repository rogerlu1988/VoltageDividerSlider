# 🔋 Voltage Divider Calculator

An interactive web-based tool to calculate the output voltage (`Vout`) of a resistive voltage divider circuit. Built with **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this calculator lets you dynamically adjust input voltage and resistor values using intuitive slider bars.

## 🌟 Features

- 🎚 Adjustable **input voltage** (0–100 V)
- 🎛 Slider controls for:
  - Top resistor `Rtop` (0.1 kΩ to 1000 kΩ)
  - Bottom resistor `Rbottom` (0.01 kΩ to 100 kΩ)
- 🔄 Real-time output voltage calculation
- 💡 Responsive design with **Tailwind CSS**

## ⚙️ How It Works

The output voltage of a voltage divider is calculated using the formula:
